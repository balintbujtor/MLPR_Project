# MLPR_Project
This is the project for the Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition course at Politecnico di Torino 2023.
For the project I test popular binary classifiers and their performance on a dataset provided as input for the project.


The project is working and operative, however, a big refactoring is needed to make the code more readable and efficient.
The training and evaluation should be streamlined for each classifier to create separate train and test functions.
There should be another class/function that serves as the workbench for the other models to run with K-fold and for testing.
Unfortunately, until the project deadline I was not able to perform this refactoring, but I will do it in the future.
